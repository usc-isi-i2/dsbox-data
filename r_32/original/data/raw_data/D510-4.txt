The structures within the intraperitoneal space are called "intraperitoneal" (e.g. the stomach ), the structures in the abdominal cavity that are located behind the intraperitoneal space are called " retroperitoneal " (e.g. the kidneys ), and those structures below the intraperitoneal space are called "subperitoneal" or "infraperitoneal" (e.g. the bladder ).

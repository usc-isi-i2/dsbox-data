The word silencer in reference to gun suppressor remains in widespread use, although it has since fallen out of favor with some, especially among the firearms industry, being replaced with the more literally accurate term sound suppressor or just suppressor, because a "sound suppressor" does not "silence" any weapon, rather it eliminates muzzle flash and reduces the sonic pressure of a firearm discharging.

The water and smaller solutes in a hypotonic solution (a solution that has a lesser solute concentration than the solution it is referenced to) will cross a semi-permeable membrane, like dialysis tubing, into a hypertonic solution (a solution that has a higher solute concentration than the solution it is referenced to) in an attempt to reach equilibrium, where the solute concentration of each solution is in equilibrium.

The American Civil War (ACW), also known as the War between the States or simply the Civil War (see naming ), was a civil war fought from 1861 to 1865 between the United States (the "Union" or the "North") and several Southern slave states that declared their secession and formed the Confederate States of America (the "Confederacy" or the "South").

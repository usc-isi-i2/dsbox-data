Since the credit phases out at 21% (for two children and for three or more qualilfying children) or 16% (for one qualifying child), it is always preferable to have one more dollar of actual salary or wages (although technically, since the EIC table moves by fifty dollar increments, it's always preferable to have an extra fifty-dollar increment of salary or wages).

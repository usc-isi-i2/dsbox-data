North American vienna sausages are mainly made from pork , but also meat such as beef , turkey and chicken , (or blends thereof) finely ground to a paste consistency and mixed with salt and spices, notably mustard , then stuffed into a long casing , sometimes smoked and always thoroughly cooked, after which the casings are removed as with hot dogs.

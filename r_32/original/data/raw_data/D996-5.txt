With the exceptions of Louisiana , Puerto Rico , Quebec , whose private law is based on civil law , and British Columbia , whose notarial tradition stems from scrivener notary practice, a notary public in the rest of the United States and most of Canada has powers that are far more limited than those of civil-law or other common-law notaries, both of whom are qualified lawyers admitted to the bar: such notaries may be referred to as notaries-at-law or lawyer notaries.

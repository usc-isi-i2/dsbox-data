Set in the fictional town of Gulfhaven, Florida (nicknamed "Cougar Town" since its high school teams are the Cougars), the series focuses on a recently divorced woman in her forties facing the often humorous challenges, pitfalls, and rewards of life's next chapter, along with her son, ex-husband, and wine-loving friends who together make up her dysfunctional, but supportive and caring extended family.

They are best distinguished from similarly large, fuzzy bees by the form of the female hind leg, which is modified to form a corbicula : a shiny concave surface that is bare, but surrounded by a fringe of hairs used to transport pollen (in similar bees, the hind leg is completely hairy, and pollen grains are wedged into the hairs for transport).

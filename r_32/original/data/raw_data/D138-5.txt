Pancreatic cancer has an extremely poor prognosis : for all stages combined, the 1- and 5-year relative survival rates are 25% and 6%, respectively; for local disease the 5-year survival is approximately 20% while the median survival for locally advanced and for metastatic disease, which collectively represent over 80% of individuals, is about 10 and 6 months respectively.Individuals vary, however - some are only diagnosed when they are terminally ill already and therefore only have a few days or weeks.

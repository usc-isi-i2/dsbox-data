This election is notable as being the first time in U.S. history that two sitting U.S. Senators (Kennedy and Johnson) were elected as president and vice-president, a phenomenon that has been repeated once, by Barack Obama and Joe Biden in 2008 (in both cases, the president was the younger, more junior senator).

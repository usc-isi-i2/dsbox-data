After many appearances on All in the Family until Reiner and Struthers left the series in 1978 (by that time, Joey had been played most often by alternating twins Jason and Justin Draeger), the Joey Stivic character next appeared on the All in the Family spin-off series (some call it a continuation of the original) Archie Bunker's Place in a guest appearance in the November 1979 episode "Thanksgiving Reunion."

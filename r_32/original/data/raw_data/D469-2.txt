By exception the three surviving lodges that formed the world's first known Grand Lodge in London (today called the United Grand Lodge of England ) have the unique privilege to operate as time immemorial i.e. without such warrant; only one other lodge operates without a warrant - this is the Grand Stewards' Lodge in London, although it is not also entitled to the "time immemorial" title.

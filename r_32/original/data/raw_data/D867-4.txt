Sam and colleague Martin Kamen , a University of Chicago Ph.D. and researcher in chemistry and nuclear physics working under Ernest O. Lawrence at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory , set out to elucidate the path of carbon in photosynthesis by incorporating the short-lived radioactive isotope Carbon-11 (11CO2) in their many experiments between 1938 and 1942.

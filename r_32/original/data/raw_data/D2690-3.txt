Particularly notable among Saturn's moons are Titan, the second- largest moon in the Solar System, with a nitrogen-rich Earth-like atmosphere and a landscape including hydrocarbon lakes and dry river networks; and Enceladus , which emits jets of gas and dust and may harbor liquid water under its south pole region.

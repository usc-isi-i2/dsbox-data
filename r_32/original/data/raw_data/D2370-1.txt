On an automobile, a quarter panel (or rear wing as it is known in British English ) is usually considered the body panel which goes between the rear door and the trunk and typically wraps around the wheel well; however, the similar front section Fender (vehicle) , between the door and the hood, is sometimes incorrectly referred to as a quarter panel.

The term is sometimes used even more loosely to include all extant members of the order Crocodilia : which includes all members of Crocodylidae, including the tomistoma , the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae ) and the gharials (family Gavialidae ), and the rest of Crocodylomorpha , which includes all of the prehistoric crocodile relatives and ancestors.

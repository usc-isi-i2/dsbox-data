This election was also notable for being the first time in U.S. history that both major party candidates were sitting U.S. Senators, only the third time (after 1920 and 1960 ) that any sitting U.S. Senator was elected president, and only the second time that the winning President and Vice President (Obama and Biden) were both sitting U.S. Senators.

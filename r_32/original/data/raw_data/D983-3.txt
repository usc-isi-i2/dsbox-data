It is also the band's last album recorded with Ace Frehley credited as an official member (until 1998's Psycho Circus ), and its first album with Vinnie Vincent as the initially uncredited lead guitarist (Vincent would later be credited, but not featured pictorially on the cover, of 1985's reissue of the album ).

This area was the first section of Miami Beach to be developed, starting in the 1910s, thanks to the development efforts of Carl G. Fisher , the Lummus Brothers, and John S. Collins , the latter whose construction of the Collins Bridge provided the first vital land link between mainland Miami and the beaches.

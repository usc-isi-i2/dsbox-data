Typically a leaf is a thin, flattened organ borne above ground and specialized for photosynthesis , but many types of leaves are adapted in ways almost unrecognisable in those terms: some are not flat (for example many succulent leaves and conifers ), some are not above ground (such as bulb scales), and some are without major photosynthetic function (consider for example cataphylls , spines , and cotyledons ).

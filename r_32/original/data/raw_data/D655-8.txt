Joe Bonamassa's music contains a mix of several different genres: although it is primarily blues rock, since relocating to Santorini, Greece in 2009 to record the album Black Rock (named after the studios in which it was created), his music has gained eastern influences, with the addition of instruments such as the bouzouki and clarinet (for instance, on "Black Lung Heartache" from Dust Bowl and "Athens to Athens" from Black Rock).

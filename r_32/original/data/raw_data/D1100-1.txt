Gassers were based on production models from the 1930s to mid-1960s, which have been stripped of extraneous weight and jacked up using a truck beam axle to provide better weight distribution on acceleration (Beam axles are also lighter than an independent front suspension), though a raised stock front suspension is common as well.

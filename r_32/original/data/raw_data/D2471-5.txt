While the Mainstream Rock and Modern Rock were the main formats for 3 Doors Down, it wasn't expected to be a big success, the song was a moderate success hitting #14 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks and #22 on the Modern Rock Tracks , it failed to top or reach #1 on both charts due to its soft rock ballads in the song compared to its original post-grunge sounds from their other songs including their 4 previous rock and alternative hits Kryptonite, Loser , Duck and Run , and When I'm Gone, but it still became a big hit making it their 3rd #1 Top 40 Mainstream hit and their 1st #1 Adult Top 40 hit for 13 consecutive weeks.

In addition, Harry uses his Quidditch skills to capture a golden egg from a dragon called the Hungarian Horntail (in the first task of the Tri-Wizard Tournament), to capture a flying key in Philosopher's Stone , and on two key occasions in Deathly Hallows — getting hold of Ravenclaw's Diadem, and during the final fight with Voldemort — the "unerring skill of the Seeker" is useful to him in snatching the Elder Wand out of the air.

While most volcanoes are created by geological activity at tectonic plate boundaries, the Hawaii hotspot is located far from nearby plate boundaries; the classic hotspot theory, first proposed in 1963 by John Tuzo Wilson , proposes that a single, fixed mantle plume builds volcanoes that then, cut off from their source by the movement of the Pacific Plate , become increasingly inactive and eventually erode below sea level over millions of years.

During play, goal keepers are the only players who are allowed to touch the ball with any part of their body (with the exception of a player's hand considered 'part of the stick'), with this only applying within the shooting circle (also known as the D, or shooting arc, or just the circle), while field players play the ball with the flat side of their stick.

These provinces and many areas of Navarre are heavily populated by ethnic Basques, but Basque was, at least until the 1990s, not spoken as a native language in most of √Ålava, western parts of Biscay and central and southern areas of Navarre , either because it had been replaced by Spanish along the centuries, in some areas, or because it had never been spoken there, in other areas.

The Books of Samuel , 1 Kings , and 1 Chronicles are the only sources of information on David, although the Tel Dan stele (dated c. 850â€“835 BCE) contains the phrase (bytdwd), read as "House of David", which most scholars take as confirmation of the existence in the mid-9th century BCE of a Judean royal dynasty called the House of David .

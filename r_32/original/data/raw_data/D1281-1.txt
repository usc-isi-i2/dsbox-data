Serial ATA replaces the older AT Attachment standard (ATA; later referred to as Parallel ATA or PATA), offering several advantages over the older interface: reduced cable size and cost (seven conductors instead of 40), native hot swapping , faster data transfer through higher signalling rates, and more efficient transfer through an (optional) I/O queuing protocol.

With an upsurge in cruise ship traffic and the terminal's ability to handle comfortably only three large ships at a time, two new terminals have opened in the harbor â€” the Cape Liberty Cruise Port opened in 2004 in Bayonne, New Jersey (used by Royal Caribbean Cruise Line , Celebrity Cruises and Azamara Cruises ), and the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal (used by the Queen Mary 2 and other ships of the Carnival Corporation cruise brands) opened in 2006 in Brooklyn, New York .

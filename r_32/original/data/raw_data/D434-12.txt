JMOL motions may also be made after the verdict is returned, where they are called "renewed" motions for judgment as a matter of law (RJMOL), but the motion is still commonly known by its former name, judgment notwithstanding verdict , or j.n.o.v. (from the English judgment and the Latin non obstante veredicto).

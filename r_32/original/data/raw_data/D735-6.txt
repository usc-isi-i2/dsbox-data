The offense can score points by advancing the ball into the end zone (a touchdown ) or by kicking the ball through the opponent's goalpost (a field goal ), while the defense can score points by forcing an offensive turnover and advancing the ball into the offense's end zone or by tackling the ballcarrier in the offense's end zone (a safety ).

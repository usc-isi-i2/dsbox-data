A fire hydrant (also known colloquially as a fire plug in the United States or as a johnny pump in New York City ), is an active fire protection measure, and a source of water provided in most urban, suburban and rural areas with municipal water service to enable firefighters to tap into the municipal water supply to assist in extinguishing a fire.

Siegfried Bing (26 February 1838 – 6 September 1905), who usually gave his name as S. Bing, and was thus often referenced erroneously as "Samuel Bing" (Samuel Otto Bing, 1850–1905, was his brother) was a German art dealer who lived in Paris as an adult, and who helped introduce Japanese art and artworks to the West and was a factor in the development of the Art Nouveau style during the late nineteenth century.

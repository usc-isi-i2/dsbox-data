Rocky Balboa is often wrongly credited with popularizing the red, white, and blue trunks; Creed was the first man to wear them (latterly worn by Rocky Balboa in the 3rd and 4th installments and finally by Tommy "The Machine" Gunn ( Tommy Morrison ) in the 5th installment) although normally he wore red and white, as seen in Rocky II.

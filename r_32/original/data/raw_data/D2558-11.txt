Historically, the tasks of public safety (in the sense of controlling crime), public education , public health , transportation , and infrastructure have generally been considered primarily state responsibilities, although all of these now have significant federal funding and regulation as well (based largely upon the Commerce Clause , the Taxing and Spending Clause , and the Necessary and Proper Clause of the U.S. Constitution).

Eucharist in the Catholic Church refers to both the celebration of the Mass , that is, the Eucharist liturgy , and the bread and wine which after the consecration are transubstantiated (changed in substance) into the body and blood of Jesus Christ, Lord and God, a declaration formulated by the Council of Trent with an anathema against anyone who denied this.

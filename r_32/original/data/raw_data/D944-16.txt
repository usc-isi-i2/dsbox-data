Luthor is also described as a "megavillain" by comic book critic Peter Sanderson , one of a few genre-crossing villains whose adventures take place "in a world in which the ordinary laws of nature are slightly suspended"; characters such as Professor Moriarty , Count Dracula , Hannibal Lecter , Doctor Doom , and Darth Vader , also fit this description.

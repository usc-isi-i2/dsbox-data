The early era of space exploration was driven by a " Space Race " between the Soviet Union and the United States , the launch of the first man-made object to orbit the Earth , the USSR's Sputnik 1 , on 4 October 1957, and the first Moon landing by the American Apollo 11 craft on 20 July 1969 are often taken as the boundaries for this initial period.

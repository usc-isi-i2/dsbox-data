Answer sentence selection is the task of identifying sentences that contain the answer to a given question. Answer sentence selection is a crucial subtask of the open-domain question answering (QA) problem, with the goal of extracting answers from a set of preselected sentences.  The task is to learn to select the correct sentences answering a factual question from a set of candidate sentences. Answer sentence selection can be viewed as a binary classification problem. Assume a set of questions Q, where each question q_i âˆˆ Q is associated with a list of answer sentences {a_i1, a_i2,..., a_im }, together with their judgements {y_i1, y_i2,..., y_im }, where y_ij = 1 if the answer is correct and y_ij = 0 otherwise.
